# jackson-wakeup

Listens to your microphone for the wake phrase **"hey jackson"**. When heard, it:

1) Uses OpenAI (ChatGPT) to generate an **image-generation prompt** for a **16:9** image that looks good on an **11\" digital photo frame**, based on whatever you say after the wake phrase.
2) Uses OpenAI image generation to create the image and saves it to `output/latest.png`.

The generated image is an **anthropomorphised cartoon** of your dog Jackson, using a **local reference photo** from `assets/`.

## Setup

### 1) Put a Jackson photo in assets/

Copy at least one image into `assets/` (supported: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`).

Example:
- `assets/jackson.jpg`

### 2) Install Python deps

From the project root:

- `py -m pip install -e .`

Note: on Windows, `pip` and `python` can point to the Microsoft Store alias. Using `py -m pip` ensures you install into the same Python that runs the app.

### 3) Get a Vosk speech model

This project uses Vosk for offline streaming speech-to-text.

Download an English model and unzip it into:
- `models/vosk-model/`

For example, you can use a Vosk “small” English model zip from the Vosk project releases, unzip it, and rename the extracted folder to `vosk-model`.

### 4) Set your OpenAI key

Set an environment variable:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`

### 5) Run

- `jackson-listen`

If the command isn't found, run it via:
- `py -m jackson_wakeup.cli`

Then say:
- "hey jackson make him a wizard in a library"

Output:
- `output/latest.png`

## Notes (Windows)

- Microphone capture uses `sounddevice`, which depends on PortAudio.
  - If `sounddevice` installation fails, install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools and try again.
- If your mic isn’t the default device, pass `--device N`.

## CLI options

- `--wake "hey jackson"` (change wake phrase)
- `--vosk-model path/to/model` (override model dir)
- `--device 2` (choose input device index)
